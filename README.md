A web-based complex function grapher

Uses complex.js and three.js

## TODO

-   [x] Add an option for how many points u want in a mesh (aka how good is your GPU)
-   [ ] Logarithmic height option
-   [x] Export to an image - compromised performance by adding `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` to renderer
-   [ ] Export to a `.stl` file 3D printing (probably defer [this](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) or smth)
-   [x] Optimize reloading
-   [ ] Optimize reloading _further_?
-   [ ] shiny surface
